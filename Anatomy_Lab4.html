<p>Lab Instructions</p>
<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>Lab 4 is split over two half-day sessions. You will complete two exercises during the first session and the remaining two exercises during the second session.
You will start with the exercise that corresponds to your pair number. That is, during the first session:Pairs 1 start with Exercise 1 (must prepare and complete Exercises 4.1 & 4.2)Pairs 2 start with Exercise 2 (must prepare and complete Exercises 4.2 & 4.3)Pairs 3 start with Exercise 3 (must prepare and complete Exercises 4.3 & 4.4)Pairs 4 start with Exercise 4 (must prepare and complete Exercises 4.4 & 4.1)
Exercises 4.2 and 4.4 are a dissection of the more superficial structures of the face. This is a process that should take the entire six hours that are dedicated to lab 4; i.e. it will not be completed until the end of the second session. Each pair will contribute to this process for 90 minutes on the first Tuesday, and then contribute another 90 minutes the following Tuesday. You will learn as you work, and once the dissection is complete at the end of the second session, all structures will exposed satisfactorily, and everyone can learn from the completed dissection even though they did not do the dissection in its entirety. 
The pairs that start at this station during the first session, if they work with the requisite care, will likely get no farther than skinning the face and maybe discovering and exposing the parotid duct by the end of their 90 minutes at that station. The next pair might get the facial artery and vein exposed during their 90 minutes of dissecting. That leaves the removal of the buccal fat pad and the remainder of the dissection to be completed the next week.
Dissecting requires care and patience, and 90 minutes is enough time for a pair to make a contribution before they might become fatigued and impatient, which is when mistakes are made.
REMEMBER: it is not a race. Work with care, not with speed - your group-mates are relying on you to do a good job so that they can pick it up where you leave off and make their own contribution.

<p>Previous</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>As you’ve learned, peripheral nerves that arise from spinal nerves to innervate the body wall and limbs contain specific functional subtypes of axons. These nerves contain:
somatic motor axons that innervate skeletal muscle fibres in the body wall and limbs,
general sensory axons that monitor the body wall and limbs, and
sympathetic postganglionic axons that innervate vascular smooth muscle, arrector pili muscle and glands.
Spinal nerves that arise from S2, 3 & 4 contain parasympathetic preganglionic fibres, but these fibres do not contribute to the innervation of the body wall and limbs, but exclusively to the innervation of abdominal and pelvic viscera.
In contrast, cranial nerves can be purely motor or purely sensory, or mixed. Also, four cranial nerves contain parasympathetic preganglionic axons destined to innervate smooth muscle and glands of the face, thorax and abdomen. Furthermore, some cranial nerves provide sensory input from special sense organs, providing us with vision, smell, hearing and balance senses.
This SLM groups together the cranial nerves according to their function, starting with those that are easier to learn. Like spinal nerves, cranial nerves never cross the midline, but always innervate ipsilateral      targets.</p>

<p>Three nerves are special sensory: 
Cranial nerve I, the olfactory nerve     , conveys information gathered from receptors in the nasal epithelium that respond to odorant molecules in inspired air, which we perceive as smell; a lesion of this nerve causes anosmia.
Cranial nerve II, the optic nerve     , conveys information gathered from photoreceptors in the retina, which we perceive as vision; its lesion causes a visual field deficit.
Cranial nerve VIII, the vestibulocochlear nerve, conveys information gathered from receptors in the inner ear that monitor i) balance     , and ii) sound energy which we perceive as hearing     ; lesions can cause imbalance and hearing loss.</p>

<p>Previous</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Five nerves are purely*     voluntary motor. They innervate striated muscle.
Cranial nerves III*, IV, and VI, the oculomotor     , trochlear     and abducens     nerves, control extraocular eye muscles, the voluntary muscles that position the eye in the orbit. The abducens nerve abducts the eye, the trochlear nerve depresses the adducted eye, the oculomotor nerve controls all other eye mvts.
A lesion of any one of these nerves causes the affected eye to be misaligned (strabismus), and eye movements in certain directions to be limited.
Cranial nerve III, the oculomotor nerve*, also carries parasympathetic preganglionic axons that control a smooth muscle in the eye, the sphincter pupillae; parasympathetic input causes pupillary constriction. In a lesion of the oculomotor nerve, the pupil is large (mydriasis)     .
Cranial nerve XI, the accessory nerve, controls the trapezius (shoulder shrug) and sternocleidomastoid (SCM; turning the head to the contralateral side) muscles; lesion of this nerve weakens or abolishes these movements.
Cranial nerve XII, the hypoglossal nerve     , moves the tongue; a lesion of the hypoglossal nerve paralyzes the ipsilateral tongue     ; on attempted protrusion of the tongue, the non-paralyzed side dominates, and pushes the tongue toward the weakened side.</p>

<p>Next</p>
<p>That took care of 8 of the 12 cranial nerves, three purely special sensory and five purely* voluntary motor; not so bad, so far! This leaves only four more nerves to introduce. Here’s one more that is largely general sensory:
Cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve     , is sensory to the skin of the face. It consists of the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) subdivisions. 
Read the following with reference to the figure.
Branches of the ophthalmic division, V1, (green) supply general sensory fibres to the forehead, the upper eyelid, the contents of the orbit and the tip of the nose, including portions of the nasal septum. 
Branches of the maxillary division, V2, (orange) supply sensory fibres to the skin of the lower eyelid, the side of the nose, both externally and internally, the upper cheek, the temple, the maxillary teeth, palate, and the upper lip. </p>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>Branches of the mandibular division, V3, (blue) supply sensory fibres to the skin anterior to the ear, over the lower cheek, jaw, mandibular teeth, the floor of the mouth, the lower lip and chin.
The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve is also motor to the muscles of mastication. These muscles move the jaw, allowing us to chew. A lesion of these motor branches of V3 causes weakness in these muscles; the jaw on attempted protrusion deviates toward the weakened side.</p>

<p>A lesion of a subdivision of the trigeminal nerve causes sensory deficits in a well-defined pattern, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram. In some lesions, the patient might experience a lack of sensation and in others the patient might experience pain. In either case, the distribution of the sensory deficit corresponds to that of a specific trigeminal nerve subdivision or subdivisions, depending on the location of the lesion. </p>
<p>deficits of the trigeminal nerve subdivisions is on the forehead, cheek and jaw, in a vertical line with the eye, as illustrated in the accompanying figure.</p>
<p>Cranial nerves VII, IX and X (see following) have small areas of general sensory responsibility, largely associated with touch to the external ear and ear canal (VII and X) and the pharyngotympanic tube (IX).</p>

<p>4A   The Facial Nerve</p>

<p>Previous</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve     , controls the muscles of facial expression. These are the muscles that allow us to close our eyes and mouth, smile or show our teeth, and raise our eyebrows, for instance     . If the facial nerve is lesioned, the ipsilateral face is weakened or paralyzed, and these movements cannot be performed     .</p>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>The facial nerve also carries parasympathetic preganglionic fibres destined to control secretion of the lacrimal, submandibular and sublingual glands, as well as the mucosa of the nasal and oral cavities.
The facial nerve receives taste sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue.
Finally, as noted previously, it carries general sensory fibres from portions of the external ear.</p>
<p>This leaves only three cranial nerves to introduce! These are the nerves that are more of a mixed bag. We’ll start with cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve.</p>
<h2>8. The Glossopharyngeal and Vagus Nerves</h2>

<p>Previous</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves have much in common. Both carry parasympathetic preganglionic fibres. Both carry voluntary motor fibres. Both carry general sensory fibres. They differ in their distributions.

Cranial nerve IX, the glossopharyngeal nerve     , receives taste and general sensory fibres from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue. Its general sensory distribution extends throughout the oropharynx and into the Eustachian (pharyngotympanic) tube.
It also carries parasympathetic fibres destined to control secretion of the parotid gland.
Its voluntary motor distribution will be described later, when you study the pharynx.

Cranial nerve X, the vagus nerve     , carries parasympathetic fibres destined to supply thoracic and most of the abdominal viscera. 
It is general sensory to portions of the external auditory canal, to the laryngopharynx and larynx.
It is motor to the muscles of the pharynx (swallowing) and larynx (speech); lesions of the vagus nerve can cause a hoarse voice and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).</p>

<p>4A   Parasympathetics Carried by Cranial Nerves</p>

<p>Previous</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Four cranial nerves contain parasympathetic preganglionic fibres in addition to other functional groups of axons, the oculomotor (CN III), facial (CN VII), glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves. Because the targets of the parasympathetic fibres in cranial nerves III, VII, and IX are in the face, we will study them in detail during Unit 2. The targets of the parasympathetic fibres in cranial nerve X are in the thorax and abdomen, so the parasympathetic components of the vagus nerve will be studied in Units 3 & 4. 
There is a pattern to parasympathetic outflow. Nerves arising from the central nervous system (CNS) deliver parasympathetic preganglionic outflow to their associated ganglia in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). These ganglia contain parasympathetic postganglionic neuronal cell bodies. Some parasympathetic ganglia, called terminal ganglia, are located close to the target tissue. Other parasympathetic ganglia, called intramural ganglia, are located in the wall of the target tissue    . The parasympathetic ganglia associated with the oculomotor, facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are terminal ganglia, and so are close to, but not in the target tissue. This means that the postganglionic parasympathetic fibres that arise from these ganglia must travel with another nerve to the target tissue. In all cases, the postganglionic axons arising from the terminal ganglia associated with the oculomotor, facial and glossopharyngeal nerves reach their targets by joining a branch of the trigeminal nerve.</p>

<p>4.1   The Sinuses and Air Cells</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Several of the bones of the skull contain air-filled spaces, which are often called sinuses. Alternatively, if they are arranged as a honeycomb of smaller, connected spaces, they are called air cells. 
Sinuses lighten the skull and those sinuses that connect with the nasal cavity give resonance to the voice. These spaces are lined with a mucous-producing membrane that keeps the lining tissues moist. As the mucus is continuously produced, there is a need of drainage for each of these sinuses. 
The temporal bone contains the mastoid air cells, which fill the mastoid process. The mastoid air cells open into the middle ear cavity. The middle ear cavity opens into the nasopharynx via the auditory tube. </p>
<p>OTITIS MEDIA</p>
<p>INFO</p>
<p>The swelling that accompanies inflammation of the lining of the auditory tube can block it and result in the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity. This is painful and can interfere with hearing. Children who experience repeated infections that affect the tissues of the auditory tube may have tubes inserted through the eardrum to provide an alternate route of drainage from the middle ear.</p>
<p>The paranasal sinuses are a group of such spaces that open into the nasal cavity. There are four paired sets of paranasal sinuses:
The sphenoid sinus is contained within the body of the sphenoid bone, posteromedial to the orbit.
The ethmoid air cells are a group of small, interconnected spaces within the ethmoid bone, medial to the orbit.
The maxillary sinus is the largest, and is contained within the maxillary bone, inferior to the orbit.
The frontal sinus is located in the frontal bone, superomedial to the orbit.
The paranasal sinuses will be studied in more detail in a later lab exercise on the anatomy of the nasal cavity.</p>

It is possible, therefore, that infections in this area can spread intracranially via venous drainage.</p>

<p>Paralysis of the Muscles of Facial Expression</p>
<p>INFO</p>
<p>Paralysis of these muscles will lead to abnormal facial expression, drooling, and inability to close the eye. Inability to close the eye can make it susceptible to injury, and if it cannot be closed properly, the conjunctiva can dry out and ulcerate.</p>
<p>and identify the fibres of the orbicularis oculi (B). Be warned: the skin of the eyelids is the thinnest in the body.
Orbicularis oris purses the lips and orbicularis oculi closes the eyelids. Both belong to the group of muscles known as the muscles of facial expression, which are innervated by the facial nerve, CN VII. 
You have already identified one other muscle of facial expression, the buccinator. Also included in this group are a large number of small muscles that arise from the bones of the facial skeleton and attach to the skin. They are important for the movements of the facial skin necessary for proper speech, and to create facial expressions. Do not learn the details of these remaining muscles.</p>

<p>The facial nerve (A) exits the skull through the stylomastoid foramen and enters the parotid gland (B). The stylomastoid foramen, as its name suggests, lies between the styloid process (C) and the mastoid process (D).

You will discover that parotid plexus converges within the gland to form the main trunk of the nerve. Follow it as it passes superficial to the external carotid artery (G) and the retromandibular vein (H). Trace the main trunk back toward the stylomastoid foramen, medial to the mastoid process.

<p>Note that this fits the pattern described in the prelab SLM on slide 4A 9     ; the parasympathetic preganglionic fibres from CN VII are distributed to their target tissue by branches of the trigeminal nerve, in this case the lingual nerve. Understand this pattern; it helps you to remember the paths of parasympathetic outflow, regardless of which cranial nerve it originates from, III, VII or IX.

<p>Four cranial nerves contain parasympathetic preganglionic fibres in addition to other functional groups of axons, the oculomotor (CN III), facial (CN VII), glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves. Because the targets of the parasympathetic fibres in cranial nerves III, VII, and IX are in the face, we will study them in detail during Unit 2. The targets of the parasympathetic fibres in cranial nerve X are in the thorax and abdomen, so the parasympathetic components of the vagus nerve will be studied in Units 3 & 4. 
There is a pattern to parasympathetic outflow. Nerves arising from the central nervous system (CNS) deliver parasympathetic preganglionic outflow to their associated ganglia in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). These ganglia contain parasympathetic postganglionic neuronal cell bodies. Some parasympathetic ganglia, called terminal ganglia, are located close to the target tissue. Other parasympathetic ganglia, called intramural ganglia, are located in the wall of the target tissue     . The parasympathetic ganglia associated with the oculomotor, facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are terminal ganglia, and so are close to, but not in the target tissue. This means that the postganglionic parasympathetic fibres that arise from these ganglia must travel with another nerve to the target tissue. In all cases, the postganglionic axons arising from the terminal ganglia associated with the oculomotor, facial and glossopharyngeal nerves reach their targets by joining a branch of the trigeminal nerve.</p>

Like the parasympathetic preganglionic fibres, the taste fibres in the chorda tympani join the lingual nerve (B) to enter the floor of the mouth. There they distributed to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. 
Note that the taste fibres from VII are distributed to their target tissues by the same branch of the trigeminal nerve, the lingual nerve, as are the parasympathetic fibres.</p>

<p>4.3   The PSy Innervation of the Parotid Gland Comes from CN IX</p>

<p>This graphic also describes the parasympathetic innervation of the parotid gland (A). For this salivary gland, the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres originate in the glossopharyngeal nerve, CN IX (B). Following a synapse in the otic ganglion (C), the parasympathetic postganglionic fibres join the auriculotemporal nerve (D), a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, to travel to the parotid gland.</p>
<p>button</p>
<p>Note that this, again, fits the pattern described in the prelab SLM on slide 4A 9     ; the parasympathetic preganglionic fibres from CN IX are distributed to their target tissue by branches of the trigeminal nerve, in this case the auriculotemporal nerve. 
You can see how this pattern helps you to remember the paths of parasympathetic outflow, regardless of which cranial nerve it originates from, III, VII or IX</p>

<p>Four cranial nerves contain parasympathetic preganglionic fibres in addition to other functional groups of axons, the oculomotor (CN III), facial (CN VII), glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves. Because the targets of the parasympathetic fibres in cranial nerves III, VII, and IX are in the face, we will study them in detail during Unit 2. The targets of the parasympathetic fibres in cranial nerve X are in the thorax and abdomen, so the parasympathetic components of the vagus nerve will be studied in Units 3 & 4. 
There is a pattern to parasympathetic outflow. Nerves arising from the central nervous system (CNS) deliver parasympathetic preganglionic outflow to their associated ganglia in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). These ganglia contain parasympathetic postganglionic neuronal cell bodies. Some parasympathetic ganglia, called terminal ganglia, are located close to the target tissue. Other parasympathetic ganglia, called intramural ganglia, are located in the wall of the target tissue    . The parasympathetic ganglia associated with the oculomotor, facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are terminal ganglia, and so are close to, but not in the target tissue. This means that the postganglionic parasympathetic fibres that arise from these ganglia must travel with another nerve to the target tissue. In all cases, the postganglionic axons arising from the terminal ganglia associated with the oculomotor, facial and glossopharyngeal nerves reach their targets by joining a branch of the trigeminal nerve.</p>

<p>it enters into the pterygopalatine fossa by passing through the pterygomaxillary fissure (C). 
From the pterygopalatine fossa, and through its various foramina, branches of the maxillary artery extend:
medially into the nasal cavity, 
anteriorly into the orbit, and 
inferiorly into the palate and upper teeth. 
Identify the middle meningeal branch (D) of the maxillary artery and trace it superiorly to where it disappears through the foramen spinosum (E) into the cranial cavity to supply the membranes surrounding the brain, the meninges. 
In many specimens, and as illustrated here, the auriculotemporal nerve splits to pass around on either side of the middle meningeal artery, similar to the way that University Avenue splits to pass around the provincial parliament buildings.</p>

<p>Since embarking on this exercise, you have identified the following structures and / or learned their significance. In the case of foramina, state what passes through each. In the case of muscles, state their action and innervation. In the case of nerves and arteries, describe their distribution.

on the bony skull: the borders of the infratemporal fossa: the ramus of the mandible, the lateral plate of the pterygoid process, the inferior surface of the neurocranium, the posterior surface of the maxillary bone,  the foramen ovale, spinosum and mandibular foramen, pterygomaxillary fissure and pterygopalatine fossa
in the superficial / deep prosection of the infratemporal fossa, as appropriate, identify the buccinator muscle, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles
external carotid artery, maxillary artery, superficial temporal artery
follow the maxillary artery through the infratemporal fossa and pterygomaxillary fissure into the pterygopalatine fossa; identify its branches, the inferior alveolar and middle meningeal artery, and describe their distribution. Where does the maxillary artery end? Where do its branches go from here?
inferior alveolar nerve, mental nerve, lingual nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, chorda tympani
describe the distribution of parasympathetic and taste fibres to structures in the floor of the mouth via branches of VII and V3
describe the distribution of parasympathetic fibres to the parotid gland via branches of IX and V3.

If you are satisfied with your ability to identify these structures and answer these questions, call your TA over for confirmation and for permission to move on to the next stage of the exercise.</p>
