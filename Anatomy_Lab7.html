<p>The mediastinum is the region between the pleural cavities. It extends from the sternum, anteriorly, to the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae, posteriorly. It extends from the superior thoracic aperture, above, to the inferior thoracic aperture, below. The inferior thoracic aperture is closed by the diaphragm.</p>
<p>The mediastinum contains viscera such as the thymus gland, the pericardial sac and the heart, the trachea, and the roots of the great vessels. It also contains structures passing through the thorax to or from the abdomen and neck, such as the esophagus, thoracic duct and components of the peripheral nervous system.</p>

<p>The superior mediastinum is separated from the inferior mediastinum by a transverse plane extending from the sternal angle, anteriorly, to the intervertebral disc between the T4 and T5 vertebrae.

The inferior mediastinum is subdivided further into the:
anterior mediastinum, between the sternum and the pericardial sac
middle mediastinum, which consists of the pericardial sac and contents 
posterior mediastinum between the pericardial sac and vertebrae T5 - T12</p>

It is limited, superiorly, by an oblique plane enclosing the superior thoracic aperture. 
It is limited, inferiorly, by a horizontal plane passing through the sternal angle and the intervertebral disc between the T4 and T5 vertebrae. 
Above, the superior mediastinum is continuous with the neck and below it is continuous with the inferior mediastinum.</p>

<p>Take note, in the accompanying figure, that the superior mediastinum is bordered, laterally, by the right and left mediastinal parietal pleura.
In studying the superior mediastinum, one will encounter, from anterior to posterior, the
thymus, or its remnants
phrenic nerves
superior vena cava and its tributaries, the right and left brachiocephalic veins
arch of the aorta and its three branches
trachea
vagus nerves
recurrent laryngeal branch of the left vagus nerve
esophagus
thoracic duct

Some find it helpful to remember that behind the thymus is a venous plane (SVC and tributaries), followed by an arterial plane (arch of aorta and branches), followed by wind (trachea), water (esophagus) and lymph (thoracic duct).</p>
<p>none</p>

<p>While the thymus is a significant structure in the child, during which time it is involved in the development of the immune system, it atrophies progressively after puberty. In the elderly adult, it can be difficult to discern from surrounding adipose tissue. </p>
<p>none</p>
<p>The thymus lies in the superior mediastinum immediately posterior to the manubrium of the sternum and extends, inferiorly, into the anterior mediastinum where it lies posterior to the body of the sternum. It is an irregularly shaped, bilobed structure.</p>
<h2>7. The Venous Plane</h2>

<p>7</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>Recall that the venous plane of the superior mediastinum lies behind the thymus and consists of the superior vena cava (SVC) and its tributaries, the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Recall that the brachiocephalic veins form on each side by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. </p>
<p>The brachiocephalic veins are asymmetrical because the SVC is a right-sided structure; notice in the accompanying figure that the SVC lies posterior to the right side of the manubrium and sternum.
Because of this, the left brachiocephalic vein is longer; it crosses the midline posterior to the manubrium to unite with the right brachiocephalic vein adjacent to the right first costal cartilage.
The SVC extends vertically from the first to the third costal cartilage where it opens into the right atrium. Its inferior portion, being contained within the pericardial sac, is therefore in the middle mediastinum.
Immediately before entering the pericardial sac, and at the level of the sternal angle, the SVC receives the azygous vein      .</p>

<p>In the thorax, the aorta is subdivided into the ascending aorta, arch of the aorta, and thoracic (descending) aorta. The arch of the aorta begins and ends at the level of the sternal angle and so lies wholly within the superior mediastinum. It arches from right to left and from front to back. It passes to the left of the trachea and over the left primary bronchus. </p>
<p>none</p>
<p>The arch of the aorta gives rise to three branches within the superior mediastinum, all of which are crossed anteriorly by the left brachiocephalic vein. 
On the right, the first branch of the arch of the aorta is the brachiocephalic trunk; it is a short artery that divides into the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery. 
When present, the thyroid ima artery commonly arises as a branch of the brachiocephalic trunk. It contributes to the blood supply of the thyroid gland. It is important to keep the thyroid ima artery in mind during head and neck surgeries, particularly during thyroidectomies, because if cut, it can be a source of significant bleeding.</p>

<p>The second and third branches of the arch of the aorta are the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery. The common carotid arteries mainly supply the head and neck and the subclavian arteries supply the upper limbs.</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>The ligamentum arteriosum is a remnant of the fetal ductus arteriosus which connected the pulmonary trunk to the arch of the aorta during development, thus allowing blood to bypass the non-functioning pulmonary circulation. The ductus arteriosus closes soon after birth and forms this ligamentous remnant. </p>

<p>The trachea is normally palpable in the midline as it enters the superior mediastinum at the jugular notch. The esophagus lies posterior to the trachea, immediately anterior to the vertebral column. 
In the superior mediastinum, the trachea is posterior to the thymus gland      , the left brachiocephalic vein and the brachiocephalic trunk     . Related to the trachea and esophagus on the right is the azygos vein and on the left is the arch of the aorta.</p>

<p>In the thorax they contribute parasympathetic preganglionic fibres to the esophageal, cardiac and pulmonary plexuses. They also transmit sensory information regarding visceral function back to the brainstem. They do not transmit pain signals. </p>
<p>As it enters the superior mediastinum, the right vagus nerve lies between the right brachiocephalic vein and the brachiocephalic trunk. It descends on the lateral aspect of the trachea, deep to the mediastinal parietal pleura. It then passes medial to the azygous vein and posterior to the root of the right lung to reach the esophagus in the posterior mediastinum. </p>
<p>You will recall that in the neck the vagus nerves, CNs X, lie between the common carotid arteries and the internal jugular veins. They enter the superior thoracic aperture, traverse the superior and the posterior mediastinum and ultimately pass through the diaphragm into the abdomen. </p>

<p>As it enters the superior mediastinum, the left vagus nerve lies posterior to the left brachiocephalic vein and between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries. It descends lateral to the arch of the aorta just deep to the mediastinal parietal pleura. It reaches the esophagus in the posterior mediastinum by passing posterior to the root of the left lung.
The left recurrent laryngeal nerve arises from the left vagus nerve as it crosses the arch of the aorta. It recurs medially around the arch of the aorta lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum. It ascends the neck to the larynx in the groove between the trachea and esophagus. 
You will recall that the right recurrent laryngeal nerve recurs around the right subclavian vein in the neck to similarly ascend to the larynx.

<p>The phrenic nerves arise as a series of rootlets from the third, fourth and fifth cervical spinal cord segments. You will recall that the phrenic nerves descend in the neck on the anterior surface of the anterior scalene muscle. They then pass through the superior and middle mediastinum to supply motor and sensory innervation to the diaphragm and its associated membranes, the diaphragmatic parietal pleura and the diaphragmatic parietal peritoneum. </p>
<p>As they pass through the thorax, the phrenic nerves  provide sensory innervation to adjacent tissues: the mediastinal parietal pleura, the fibrous pericardium, and the parietal layer of serous pericardium.
In the superior mediastinum, the phrenic nerves lie lateral to both the vagus nerves and brachiocephalic veins. The right phrenic nerve continues inferiorly along the right side of the superior vena cava. The left phrenic nerve       continues inferiorly lateral to the arch of the aorta.
In the middle mediastinum, the phrenic nerves pass anterior to the roots of the lungs and descend lateral to the pericardial sac in the loose connective tissue between it and the mediastinal parietal pleura. In the thorax, the phrenic nerves are accompanied by the pericardiophrenic vessels.</p>

<p>Part 2: Introduction to the Lower Limb
When you have learned the material presented in this exercise, you will be able to:
describe the deep fascia of the lower limb
fascial compartments of the lower limb
superficial veins of the lower limb</p>

<p>Rectangle 2</p>

<p>Previous</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>Deep to the skin of the limbs is a layer of superficial fascia consisting of loose connective tissue (CT) and containing a variable amount of adipose.  It is continuous with that covering the remainder of the body, such as Camper’s fascia of the abdominal wall. This layer can also be called the hypodermis.
Below this superficial fascia is a deep fascia composed of dense CT that surrounds the musculature of the body. It is particularly robust in the limbs, where it forms sleeve-like structures that enclose muscles. In the lower limb it forms the fascia lata of the thigh and the crural fascia of the leg. 
Septae     extend from this enveloping fascia to the bones of the limb, creating compartments that contain groups of muscles, nerves, blood vessels and lymphatics. Because the deep fascia and septae are composed of inextensible dense CT, fluid accumulation within these compartments increases pressure, compressing their contents, including nerves and blood vessels. This can lead to compartment syndromes.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>The muscles within a compartment have common actions and nerve supplies, as you will learn in Unit 5, next September. For now, focus on the fascia, fascial compartments and vasculature of the lower limb.</p>
<h2>17. Two Distinct Sets of Veins Return Blood to the Heart</h2>

<p>7A   Two Distinct Sets of Veins Return Blood to the Heart</p>
<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>There are two sets of veins in the body, deep and superficial. Deep veins accompany arteries, usually with the same name. Superficial veins have no accompanying arteries. In the limbs, deep veins are located within the fascial compartments with the muscles, while superficial veins run in the superficial fascia of the limb. Shunting of blood between the two sets of veins functions in temperature regulation; the greater the volume of blood in the superficial veins, the greater the heat loss, and vice versa. 
Superficial veins end by draining into deep veins. The deep veins then ultimately drain into either of the venae cavae, thus returning all systemic venous blood to the right atrium.
In the lower limb, superficial veins begin at the dorsal      venous arch     , which collects blood from the foot and drains it proximally. The dorsal venous arch continues laterally as the small saphenous vein, which passes posterior to the lateral malleolus and it continues medially as the great saphenous vein, which passes anterior to the medial malleolus. 
The small saphenous vein continues in the posterior midline of the leg      to the level of the popliteal     fossa. At this level, the small saphenous vein passes through an opening in the deep fascia of the leg to drain into the deep venous circulation by emptying into the popliteal vein.
The great saphenous vein crosses the knee a hands-breadth posterior to the medial border of the patella (see image on base layer), and from there, it takes a relatively straight course toward the inguinal ligament.</p>

<h2>3. The Mediastinum</h2>
<p>In Lab 2.4 you learned that the thorax includes, in addition to the pleural cavities and their contents, an intermediate region called the mediastinum     . It extends from the superior thoracic aperture to the inferior thoracic aperture, and from the sternum, anteriorly, to the thoracic vertebrae, posteriorly. 
Remember the superior thoracic aperture is bordered by the T1 vertebral body, the first ribs and the superior border of the manubrium. 
The inferior thoracic aperture is bordered by the xiphisternal joint, the costal margin, ribs 11 and 12, and the T12 vertebral body.</p>

<p>IF YOU ARE WORKING ON CADAVER 1, identify any remaining attachments of the SCM, sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles to the sternum. Using scissors, cut through their attachments to the manubrium and reflect them superiorly. As you work, identify the attachment of the anterior scalene muscle to the first rib. 
Identify the phrenic nerve on the anterior surface of the anterior scalene. Cut the attachment of the anterior scalene to rib 1, but leave it in place. Leave the phrenic nerve intact.</p>

Recall that the internal thoracic arteries branch from the subclavian arteries and the internal thoracic veins are tributaries of the brachiocephalic veins.
Once this is complete, remove the manubrium with the attached medial ends of the first ribs and wrap it up with the chest plate. 
The contents of the superior mediastinum, embedded in connective tissue, are now exposed for further dissection.</p>
<p>The goal here is to remove the manubrium and the medial ends of the first ribs (remember, the ribs have been cut bilaterally for you), thus opening the superior mediastinum for dissection.
If you are working on cadaver 2, it might be best to start by cleaning the anterior and superior surfaces of the manubrium before going on to clean its posterior surface, as explained below.</p>

<p>The thymus is located immediately posterior to the manubrium, and extends some distance inferiorly into the anterior mediastinum. Most of our body donors are elderly adults, and as such, their thymus will be small and difficult to distinguish from surrounding adipose and connective tissue. However, you might be able to identify it if you know what to look for: the thymus will be slightly pinker in colour as compared to the surrounding adipose tissue. Furthermore, the lobules of the thymus are smaller than those of the surrounding adipose. See if you can discern it.</p>

Identify the left and right vagus nerves and their recurrent branches. Around what structures does each recur? How does a lesion of a recurrent laryngeal nerve affect the larynx? 
Trace both vagi toward the esophagus and be able to describe their course relative to other mediastinal structures, such as the roots of the lungs.
Identify the trachea and the right and left primary bronchi. What is the carina? Describe three ways in which the right and left primary bronchi differ, and the clinical significance of this. 
What vessel arches over the right primary bronchus? What vessel arches over the left primary bronchus?
The plane between the sternal angle and the intervertebral disc between the T4 and T5 vertebrae is an important anatomical landmark, not only because it separates the superior from the inferior mediastinum.

<p>Deep to the skin of the limbs is a layer of superficial fascia consisting of loose connective tissue (CT) and containing a variable amount of adipose.  It is continuous with that covering the remainder of the body, such as Camper’s fascia of the abdominal wall. This layer can also be called the hypodermis.
Below the superficial fascia is a deep fascia composed of dense CT that surrounds the musculature of the body. It is particularly robust in the limbs, where it forms sleeve-like structures that enclose muscles. In the lower limb it forms the fascia lata of the thigh and the crural fascia of the leg. 
Septae     extend from this enveloping fascia to the bones of the limb, creating compartments that contain groups of muscles, nerves, blood vessels and lymphatics. Because the deep fascia and septae are composed of inextensible dense CT, fluid accumulation within these compartments increases pressure, compressing their contents, including nerves and blood vessels. This can lead to compartment syndromes.</p>

<p>The muscles within a compartment often have common actions and nerve supplies, as you will learn in Unit 5, next September. For now, you will focus on the fascia, fascial compartments and vasculature of the lower limb.</p>

<p>Rectangle 2</p>

<p>Previous</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>There are two sets of veins in the body, deep and superficial. Deep veins accompany arteries, usually with the same name. Superficial veins have no accompanying arteries. In the limbs, deep veins are located within the fascial compartments with the muscles, while superficial veins run in the superficial fascia of the limb. Shunting of blood between the two sets of veins functions in temperature regulation; the greater the volume of blood in the superficial veins, the greater the heat loss, and vice versa. 
Superficial veins end by draining into deep veins. The deep veins then ultimately drain into either of the venae cavae, thus returning all systemic venous blood to the right atrium.
In the lower limb, superficial veins begin at the dorsal      venous arch     , which collects blood from the foot and drains it proximally. The dorsal venous arch continues laterally as the small saphenous vein, which passes posterior to the lateral malleolus and it continues medially as the great saphenous vein, which passes anterior to the medial malleolus. 
The small saphenous vein continues in the posterior midline of the leg      to the level of the popliteal     fossa. At this level, the small saphenous vein passes through an opening in the deep fascia of the leg to drain into the deep venous circulation by emptying into the popliteal vein.
The great saphenous vein crosses the knee a hands-breadth posterior to the medial border of the patella (see image on base layer), and from there, it takes a relatively straight course toward the inguinal ligament.</p>

<p>Dense CT intermuscular septae emanating from the fascia lata merge with the periosteum of the femur to subdivide the thigh into three compartments: anterior, posterior and medial. The muscles in each of these compartments have common actions, with the muscles of the anterior compartment extending     the knee and the muscles of the posterior compartment flexing      the knee. The muscles of the medial compartment largely act at the hip, which they adduct     . 
You will now return to you lab to study a specimen dissected to demonstrate the muscles, nerves and blood vessels of the lower limb. The CT septae will have largely been removed during dissection. For now, you will focus your study on the blood vessels of the lower limb.</p>

<p>The femoral artery is like an expressway, while the deep femoral artery is like collector lanes.  The femoral artery largely functions to deliver blood to the leg     , and as such, has few branches in the thigh. 
The deep femoral artery, on the other hand, gives many branches in the thigh, and these branches are responsible for supplying the hip joint, the tissues of the anterior and posterior compartments of the thigh, and some of the medial compartment, as well.</p>

<p>It is stating the obvious to say that branches of the deep femoral artery supply the tissues of the anterior compartment of the thigh. It is less intuitive, however, to learn that branches of the deep femoral artery also supply the tissues of the posterior compartment of the thigh, as well as contributing to the blood supply of the medial compartment. This is the role of the perforating branches of the deep femoral artery.</p>

<p>Turn your attention to the popliteal fossa, a diamond-shaped region in the posterior aspect of the knee.  Adipose tissue normally packs the popliteal fossa, and popliteal lymph nodes, deep lymph nodes of the leg, are located here. These tissues have been removed from the prosection in order to make the vessels easier for you to find. </p>

The genicular     anastomosis     is a rich anastomosis that surrounds the knee. It consists of descending and ascending genicular arteries which anastomose freely around the joint. It can provide a clinically significant alternative route for blood to travel distally when an obstruction blocks the main arterial path through the popliteal artery.</p>

<p>The Popliteal Pulse
A popliteal pulse may be felt in the popliteal fossa. The popliteal artery is surrounded by much adipose tissue in the living person, and can be hard to locate without the application of significant pressure. Even then, it may not be palpable. This is not concerning if the distal pulses, the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses, can be found.</p>

<p>The tibia and fibula are joined by a dense sheet of CT, the crural interosseous membrane. In addition, dense CT intermuscular septae emanating from the deep fascia of the leg, the crural fascia, merge with the periosteum of the tibia and fibula.  
These CT structures subdivide the leg into three compartments: anterior, posterior and, unlike the thigh, lateral. The muscles in each of these compartments have common actions, with the muscles of the anterior compartment dorsiflexing the talocrural (ankle) joint and the muscles of the posterior compartment plantarflexing     the talocrural joint. 
Certain muscles of these two compartments work synergistically to invert     the foot. The muscles of the lateral compartment act to evert     the foot.</p>

<p>Once again, while the lymphatic drainage of the lower limb cannot be seen in the prosected specimen, it must be understood. 
The deep lymphatics drain proximally alongside the deep veins of the limb. 
Lymph passes through deep nodes of the leg, the popliteal nodes, located in the popliteal fossa, and continues to drain proximally alongside the femoral vein. It next passes through the deep inguinal nodes, located in the femoral triangle in association with the femoral vein . The deep inguinal nodes receive lymph from the superficial inguinal nodes, which are in the superficial fascia, associated with the terminus of the great saphenous vein. From the deep inguinal nodes, the lymph drains next through the external iliac nodes on its way to the para-aortic nodes and the cisterna chyle.</p>

<p>Since the last Progress Check, you have identified the following structures and learned the answers to the following questions:
Identify the common iliac artery (where does it arise?), external and internal iliac arteries (name the branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the medial thigh). 
Name the compartments of the thigh. Identify the femoral artery (where does the femoral vein lie, relative to the artery?), deep femoral artery, medial and lateral circumflex humeral arteries, perforating branches of the deep femoral artery, and popliteal artery. What is the name of the major arterial anastomosis around the knee?
What is the landmark at which the external iliac artery and vein become the femoral artery and vein? What is the landmark at which the femoral artery and vein become the popliteal artery and vein? 
Name the compartments of the leg. Identify the anterior and posterior tibial arteries (How does the anterior tibial artery gain access to the anterior compartment of the leg?), fibular artery, dorsalis pedis, medial and lateral plantar arteries. 
Describe the location of four pulse points in the lower leg. Which one is particularly hard to palpate and why? What is the anatomical landmark for locating the dorsalis pedis pulse? What is the anatomical landmark for locating the posterior tibial pulse?
What are the two major groups of deep lymph nodes in the lower limb? With what vessels are they associated?
If you are satisfied with your ability to identify these structures and answer these questions, call your TA over for confirmation and for permission to move on to the next exercise.</p>
