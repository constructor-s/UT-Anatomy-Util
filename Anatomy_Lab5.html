<p>Next</p>
<p>Lab 5 is split over two half-day sessions. You will complete two exercises during the first session and the remaining two exercises during the second session.
You will start with the exercise that corresponds to your pair number. That is, during the first session:Pairs 1 start with Exercise 1 (must prepare and complete Exercises 5.1 & 5.2)Pairs 2 start with Exercise 2 (must prepare and complete Exercises 5.2 & 5.3)Pairs 3 start with Exercise 3 (must prepare and complete Exercises 5.3 & 5.4)Pairs 4 start with Exercise 4 (must prepare and complete Exercises 5.4 & 5.1)
Exercises 5.1 and 5.3 are a dissection of the more superficial structures of the neck. This is a process that should take the entire six hours that are dedicated to lab 5; i.e. it will not be completed until the end of the second session. Each pair will contribute to this process for 90 minutes on the first Tuesday, and then contribute another 90 minutes the following Tuesday. You will learn as your work, and once the dissection is complete at the end of the second session, all structures will exposed satisfactorily, and everyone can learn from the completed dissection even though they did not do the dissection in its entirety. 
Dissecting requires care and patience, and 90 minutes is enough time for a pair to make a contribution before they might become fatigued and impatient, which is when mistakes are made.
REMEMBER: it is not a race. Work with care, not with speed - your group-mates are relying on you to do a good job so that they can pick it up where you leave off and make their own contribution.
Exercises 5.2 and 5.4 are an exploration of the oral and nasal cavities. Cadaver 2 has been decapitated, and its head split in the midline. One half head will be used for each exercise. The four pairs around the room, A – D, working on a given exercise simultaneously will gather together around one table. In this manner, you can all learn together and from each other, and your TA can guide you all at once.</p>

Notice that the bilaterally-paired nasal cavities, depicted in blue, are superior to the oral cavity, depicted in purple. 
The pharynx, depicted in green, is a single continuous space that is subdivided into the nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx.
Notice that the nasopharynx is posterior to the nasal cavities and that the oropharynx is posterior to the oral cavity.
The laryngopharynx continues inferiorly as the esophagus, thus leading into the digestive tract, while it opens anteriorly into the larynx and trachea, thus leading into the respiratory tract.</p>

Notice that the oral cavity opens anteriorly at the oral fissure. Its roof is formed by the hard palate, its floor is formed by the tongue and associated mucosa, and its lateral walls are formed by the cheeks.
The oral cavity ends posteriorly at the oropharyngeal isthmus     , which is the narrowing that leads to the oropharynx. The oropharyngeal isthmus is guarded by the soft palate, which, as depicted by the blue arrows in the diagram, is raised in swallowing to isolate the oropharynx from the nasopharynx. This ensures that, in swallowing, food proceeds toward the digestive tract, and not upward into the nasal cavities.</p>

As shown in the diagram, the palatine tonsil is located in the angle between these two muscles.
These muscles both function to close the oropharyngeal isthmus by depressing the soft palate and pulling their respective folds toward the midline. In addition, the palatoglossus elevates the tongue and the palatopharyngeus elevates the pharynx. These actions occur during swallowing and are illustrated here     :

The greater palatine nerve supplies the hard palate, and the lesser palatine nerve supplies the soft palate.
The nasopalatine branch of the maxillary nerve (E) reaches the anterior part of the palate from the nasal septum, by passing through the incisive canal (F). 
Blood supply to the palate is from the palatine branches of the maxillary artery (G) which travel with the palatine nerves.</p>

<p>The tongue can be described as a bag of bilaterally paired muscles covered by amucous membrane. The muscles can be the divided into 2 groups. 
The intrinsic muscles are entirely contained within the substance of the tongue and have no attachment to surrounding skeletal structures. The fibres of the intrinsic muscles are oriented in all 3 planes and are primarily used for shaping the tongue. 
The extrinsic muscles, on the other hand, have one end attached to a skeletal structure, while the other end blends into the muscles of the tongue. Extrinsic muscles function primarily for controlling the position of the tongue. 
The intrinsic and most extrinsic muscles are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve, C.N. XII.</p>

<p>The floor of the oral cavity, including the teeth and tongue, receive sensory innervation from branches of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, V3. These include the lingual nerve and the inferior alveolar nerve     .  
The chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, VII, carries taste afferents from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue and parasympathetic efferents to the floor of the mouth, including to the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. These fibres, both taste and parasympathetic, are ultimately delivered to the floor of the mouth by the lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, V3. </p>

<p>Sympathetic fibres to the oral cavity, both above and below the oral fissure (i.e. to both the floor and roof of the mouth), arise from spinal level T1. These preganglionic sympathetic fibres ascend in the sympathetic chain to synapse on postganglionic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion. Postganglionic axons are distributed to their targets either in branches of the trigeminal nerve, V, or by traveling with blood vessels     .</p>

<p>The Distribution of Sympathetics to the Head

Sympathetic preganglionic fibres destined to innervate targets in the head ascend through the sympathetic chain from cell bodies in the lateral grey horns of the T1 level. 
Those destined for the skin of the C2 - C8 dermatomes synapse onto postganglionic cell bodies in the inferior, middle and superior cervical ganglia. Sympathetic postganglionic fibres then pass through grey rami communicantes to join cervical spinal nerves for distribution to skin.
For innervation of targets in the face, sympathetic preganglionic fibres synapse in the superior cervical ganglion, specifically, and their postganglionic axons form the carotid plexus. As the common carotid artery branches, the sympathetic postganglionic fibres are delivered to their target tissues.</p>

<p>The nasal cavity is a passageway for air, but also serves to sense odorant molecules and to warm, filter, and humidify the air during inspiration. These latter functions are carried out by the histological properties of a well-vascularised, sticky, mucous membrane that lines the nasal cavity and over which the air passes to reach the pharynx posteriorly. To achieve these goals the nasal septum and the conchae     (turbinates     ) serve to increase the surface area of mucous membrane over which the air must pass. 
The superior, middle and inferior conchae are projections from the lateral wall that curve medially into the nasal cavity. The recesses that are created on the lateral sides of the conchae are the superior, middle and inferior meatuses     . The recess above the superior concha is the spheno-ethmoidal recess.
The conchae not only increase the surface area over which air passes, but they also create turbulence which helps increase contact between the air and the mucosa. 
The function of olfaction is restricted to the mucosa of the superior concha and above.</p>

The paranasal air sinuses are named according to the bone in which they are located. Thus, they are the frontal sinus (A), ethmoidal air cells (B), the maxillary sinus (C) and sphenoid sinus (see next slide).
The sinuses of the ethmoid bone, the ethmoid air cells, consist of a group of small spaces, much like clusters of soap bubbles, within the lateral masses of the ethmoid bone.

<p>Like almost all structures inferior to the eyes and superior to the oral fissure, including the skin of the face, the general sensory innervation to the walls of the nasal cavity comes from branches of the maxillary nerve, V2. They gain access to the nasal cavity by passing through the sphenopalatine foramen from the pterygopalatine fossa. Their names describe their distribution.
Lateral nasal branches (A) of the maxillary nerve (V2) supply much of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity     . 
The nasopalatine branch (B) of the maxillary nerve (V2) crosses the roof of the nose from lateral to medial, from the sphenopalatine foramen to the mucosa of the nasal septum. The distal part of the nasopalatine nerve leaves the anterior part of the septum to pass through the incisive foramen (C) to innervate the anterior portion of the oral surface of the hard palate.

<p>Thus, most of the nasal cavity is innervated by branches of the maxillary nerve, V2. 
However, the anterior part of the lateral wall and septum is innervated by branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, V1. These are the anterior ethmoidal nerves (D)     .</p>

<p>It might help to remember the pattern of innervation of the nasal cavity if you notice that it parallels what you already know about general sensation from the external surface of the nose.
The skin of the tip of the nose is innervated by branches of V1, just like the anterior part of the lateral wall and septum, internally. 
That of the lateral sides of the nose is innervated by the infraorbital nerve, a branch of V2. Branches of V2 also innervated the lateral wall of the nasal cavity deep to this portion of the skin.</p>

<p>The sphenopalatine artery (A), a branch of the maxillary artery (B) enters the mucosa of the nasal cavity via the sphenopalatine foramen. Its lateral nasal branches (C) supply much of the lateral wall, and its septal branches (D) cross the roof of the nose to supply blood to the nasal septum. 
While most of the nasal mucosa receive blood from branches of the maxillary artery, 
the ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery (E) supply the olfactory part of the nasal mucosa, and 
branches of the facial artery (F) supply of the mucosa in the anterior part of the nose, and 
branches of the greater palatine artery (G) ascends via the incisive foramen to contribute to the supply of the anterior nasal septum

<p>You are well familiar with the distribution of PSy fibres to targets in V3 territory, i.e. BELOW the oral fissure.  It involves the chorda tympani branch of C.N. VII for the submandibular and sublingual glands and the mucosa of the floor of the mouth and it involves the lesser petrosal nerve from C.N. IX for the parotid gland. In both cases, the PSy postganglionic fibres are distributed to their targets with general sensory branches of V3         .</p>
<p>A similar pattern applies for the distribution of PSy fibres to targets in the V2 territory. PSy preganglionic fibres arising from C.N. VII are carried in its branch, the greater petrosal nerve. These fibres synapse onto postganglionic neurons in the pterygopalatine ganglion. The postganglionic axons arising from the pterygopalatine ganglion join, and are distributed with general sensory branches of V2. Thus, they reach the mucosa of the nasal cavities with the lateral nasal and nasopalatine nerves, the hard palate and soft palate with the greater and lesser palatine nerves, and the nasopharynx with the pharyngeal branch of V2.</p>

<p>The suprahyoid muscles are a group of muscles that connect the hyoid bone with the skull. This group includes the digastric, which as its name implies, consists of two muscle bellies, the anterior (A) and posterior (B) bellies of the digastric. The 2 parts of the muscle are connected by a tendon which passes through a loop of fascia attached to the hyoid bone near the lesser horn (C). 
In addition, the suprahyoid muscles include the mylohyoid (D), stylohyoid (E) and geniohyoid (F) muscles. Geniohyoid is deep to the mylohyoid, and will be seen in a later lab. By virtue of their attachments to the hyoid bone, the suprahyoid muscles can raise the larynx during speech and swallowing. </p>

The pharynx, depicted in green, is a continuous space that is subdivided into three parts: the nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx.
Notice that the nasopharynx is posterior to the nasal cavities and that the oropharynx is posterior to the oral cavity.
The laryngopharynx continues inferiorly as the esophagus, thus leading into the digestive tract, while it opens anteriorly into the larynx and trachea, thus leading into the respiratory tract.</p>

<p>Review the features of the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity is a passageway for air, but also serves to sense odorant molecules and to warm, filter, and humidify the air during inspiration. These latter functions are carried out by the histological properties of a well-vascularised, sticky, mucous membrane that lines the nasal cavity and over which the air passes to reach the pharynx posteriorly. To achieve these goals the nasal septum and the conchae     (turbinates      ) serve to increase the surface area of mucous membrane over which the air must pass. 
The superior, middle and inferior conchae are projections from the lateral wall that curve medially into the nasal cavity. The recesses that are created on the lateral sides of the conchae are the superior, middle and inferior meatuses      . The recess above the superior concha is the spheno-ethmoidal recess.
The conchae not only increase the surface area over which air passes, but they also create turbulence which helps increase contact between the air and the mucosa. 
The function of olfaction is restricted to the mucosa of the superior concha and above.</p>

<p>Review:
The paranasal air sinuses are cavities in the bones of the skull that open into the nasal cavity. They are lined by the same mucus membrane that lines the nasal cavity, and the mucus produced in these sinuses drains through these openings into the nasal cavities. 
The paranasal air sinuses are named according to the bone in which they are located. Thus, they are the frontal sinus (A), ethmoidal air cells (B), the maxillary sinus (C) and sphenoid sinus (see next slide).
The sinuses of the ethmoid bone, the ethmoid air cells, consist of a group of small spaces, much like clusters of soap bubbles, within the lateral masses of the ethmoid bone. Note in the lower diagram that they are located lateral to the sphenoethmoidal recess (D) and the superior (E) and middle (F) meatuses. The posterior ethmoid air cells open into the superior meatus (next slide).  </p>

The nasopalatine branch (B) of the maxillary nerve (V2) crosses the roof of the nose from lateral to medial, from the sphenopalatine foramen to the mucosa of the nasal septum. The distal part of the nasopalatine nerve leaves the anterior part of the septum to pass through the incisive foramen (C) to innervate the anterior portion of the oral surface of the hard palate. Thus, most of the nasal cavity is innervated by branches of the maxillary nerve, V2. 
However, the anterior part of the lateral wall and septum is innervated by branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, V1. These are the anterior ethmoidal nerves (D), which branch from the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve     .</p>

<p>It might help to remember the pattern of innervation of the nasal cavity if you notice that it parallels what you already know about general sensation from the external surface of the nose.

The skin of the tip of the nose is innervated by branches of V1, just like the anterior part of the lateral wall and septum, internally. 

Skin of the lateral sides of the nose is innervated by the infraorbital nerve, a branch of V2. Branches of V2 also innervate the lateral wall of the nasal cavity deep to this portion of the skin. It makes sense!</p>

While most of the nasal mucosa receive blood from branches of the maxillary artery, 
the ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery (E) supply the olfactory part of the nasal mucosa, and

<p>You are well familiar with the distribution of PSy fibres to targets in V3 territory, i.e. BELOW the oral fissure.  It involves the chorda tympani branch of C.N. VII for the submandibular and sublingual glands and the mucosa of the floor of the mouth and it involves the lesser petrosal nerve from C.N. IX for the parotid gland. In both cases, the PSy postganglionic fibres are distributed to their targets with general sensory branches of V3         .</p>
<p>A similar pattern applies for the distribution of PSy fibres to targets in the V2 territory. PSy preganglionic fibres arising from C.N. VII are carried in its branch, the greater petrosal nerve. These fibres synapse onto postganglionic neurons in the pterygopalatine ganglion. The postganglionic axons arising from the pterygopalatine ganglion join, and are distributed with general sensory branches of V2. Thus, they reach the mucosa of the nasal cavities with the lateral nasal and nasopalatine nerves, the hard palate and soft palate with the greater and lesser palatine nerves, and the nasopharynx with the pharyngeal branch of V2.</p>

<p>Several muscles act on the soft palate during speech and swallowing, including the palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus muscles (see activity 5.4) from the oral side and the tensor and levator veli palatini muscles on the nasal side, described here.
On the diagram, identify the palatal aponeurosis (A). Much of the tensor veli      palatini (B) attaches to the lateral surface of the medial pterygoid plate (C) and only a small portion of the muscle will be seen in today’s dissection. The tendon of the muscle loops under a projection of the medial pterygoid plate called the pterygoid hamulus (D) to fan out into the soft palate and blend with the tendon of the muscle on the opposite side. The tensor veli palatini, as the name implies, functions to stiffen the soft palate, and opens the pharyngotympanic tube during swallowing. It is innervated by a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve V3. 
The levator veli palatini (E) muscle descends from the petrous temporal bone to insert into the superior surface of the palatine aponeurosis. The LVP is the only muscle capable of raising the soft palate, which isolates the nasal cavity from the oral cavity during swallowing     . LVP is innervated by the vagus nerve, CN X.
Notice in the accompanying diagram that the TVP is anterior to the pharyngotympanic tube and to the LVP. 
You will now demonstrate this relationship in dissection.</p>

The schematic on the right is a useful starting point for understanding the relationships between these spaces.
Notice that the bilaterally-paired nasal cavities, depicted in blue, are superior to the oral cavity, depicted in purple. 
The pharynx, depicted in green, is a single continuous space that is subdivided into the nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx.
Notice that the nasopharynx is posterior to the nasal cavities and that the oropharynx is posterior to the oral cavity.
The laryngopharynx continues inferiorly as the esophagus, thus leading into the digestive tract, while it opens anteriorly into the larynx and trachea, thus leading into the respiratory tract.</p>

<p>Review:
The previous schematic is extended here, to focus more closely on the oral cavity.
Notice that the oral cavity opens anteriorly at the oral fissure. Its roof is formed by the hard palate, its floor is formed by the tongue and associated mucosa, and its lateral walls are formed by the cheeks.
The oral cavity ends posteriorly at the oropharyngeal isthmus     , which is the narrowing that leads to the oropharynx. The oropharyngeal isthmus is guarded by the soft palate, which, as depicted by the blue arrows in the diagram, is raised in swallowing to isolate the oropharynx from the nasopharynx. This ensures that, in swallowing, food proceeds toward the digestive tract, and not upward into the nasal cavities.</p>

Exactly as their names suggest, the palatoglossus muscles extend from the soft palate to the tongue, and the palatopharyngeus muscles extend from the soft palate to the wall of the pharynx.
As shown in the diagram, the palatine tonsil is located in the angle between these two muscles.
These muscles both function to close the oropharyngeal isthmus by depressing the soft palate and pulling their respective folds toward the midline. In addition, the palatoglossus elevates the tongue and the palatopharyngeus elevates the pharynx. These actions occur during swallowing and are illustrated here     :

<p>Recall the description of the tongue: it is the largest structure in the oral cavity. Approximately the anterior 2/3 lies horizontally within the oral cavity, and its surface is covered with projections called papillae     . There are 3 different types of papillae; filiform, fungiform and circumvallate. The taste buds are located in the fungiform and circumvallate types. The posterior 1/3 of the tongue is vertically oriented and faces into the oropharynx. It is separated from the anterior 2/3 by a v-shaped groove called the terminal sulcus.

The tongue can be described as a bag of bilaterally paired muscles covered by amucous membrane. The muscles can be the divided into 2 groups. The intrinsic muscles are entirely contained within the substance of the tongue and have no attachment to surrounding skeletal structures. The fibres of the intrinsic muscles are oriented in all 3 planes and are primarily used for shaping the tongue. 
The extrinsic muscles, on the other hand, have one end attached to a skeletal structure, while the other end blends into the muscles of the tongue. Extrinsic muscles function primarily for controlling the position of the tongue. 
The intrinsic and most extrinsic muscles are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve, C.N. XII.</p>

<p>tongue will point to the side of the lesion when the patient is asked to protrude their tongue. This is because the side of the tongue with the functioning nerve protrudes normally, but the side with the disfunctional nerve cannot, and the muscle on the intact side pushes the tongue toward the side of the lesion. Thus, as a clinician, you test for the functioning of the hypoglossal nerve by asking the patient to protrude their tongue. If both nerves are normal, the patient’s tongue will stay in the midline.

With the exception of the palatoglossus muscle which is innervated by the vagus nerve, CN X, both the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve, CN XII. 
For the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, general sensation (pain, temperature, touch, and pressure) is carried by the lingual branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, V3. Taste is carried by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, CN VII.

<p>The nasal cavity is a passageway for air, but also serves to sense odorant molecules and to warm, filter, and humidify the air during inspiration. These latter functions are carried out by the histological properties of a well-vascularised, sticky, mucous membrane that lines the nasal cavity and over which the air passes to reach the pharynx posteriorly. To achieve these goals the nasal septum and the conchae     (turbinates     ) serve to increase the surface area of mucous membrane over which the air must pass. 
The superior, middle and inferior conchae are projections from the lateral wall that curve medially into the nasal cavity. The recesses that are created on the lateral sides of the conchae are the superior, middle and inferior meatuses     . The recess above the superior concha is the spheno-ethmoidal recess.
The conchae not only increase the surface area over which air passes, but they also create turbulence which helps increase contact between the air and the mucosa. 
The function of olfaction is restricted to the mucosa of the superior concha and above.</p>

<p>Almost all structures inferior to the eyes and superior to the oral fissure, including the skin of the face, the general sensory innervation to the walls of the nasal cavity comes from branches of the maxillary nerve, V2. They gain access to the nasal cavity by passing through the sphenopalatine foramen from the pterygopalatine fossa. Their names describe their distribution.
Lateral nasal branches (A) of the maxillary nerve (V2) supply much of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity    . 
The nasopalatine branch (B) of the maxillary nerve (V2) crosses the roof of the nose from lateral to medial, from the sphenopalatine foramen to the mucosa of the nasal septum. The distal part of the nasopalatine nerve leaves the anterior part of the septum to pass through the incisive foramen (C) to innervate the anterior portion of the oral surface of the hard palate.

<p>Thus, most of the nasal cavity is innervated by branches of the maxillary nerve, V2. 
However, the anterior part of the lateral wall and septum is innervated by branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, V1. These are the anterior ethmoidal nerves (D).</p>

<p>The sphenopalatine artery (A), a branch of the maxillary artery (B) enters the mucosa of the nasal cavity via the sphenopalatine foramen. Its lateral nasal branches (C) supply much of the lateral wall, and its septal branches (D) cross the roof of the nose to supply blood to the nasal septum. 
While most of the nasal mucosa receive blood from branches of the maxillary artery, 
the ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery (E) supply the olfactory part of the nasal mucosa, and 
branches of the facial artery (F) supply of the mucosa in the anterior part of the nose, and 
branches of the greater palatine artery (G) ascends via the incisive foramen to contribute to the supply of the anterior nasal septum
These vessels anastomose freely within the nasal mucosa. </p>
<p>The anastomoses in the</p>
<p>INFO</p>
<p>anterior, inferior, nasal septum between branches of the maxillary, facial and ophthalmic arteries are </p>
<p>particularly rich, and create a complex called Keisselbach’s plexus (H), making this area particularly prone to nosebleeds (epistaxis). This area is commonly referred to as Keisselbach’s area or Little’s area. The majority of nosebleeds occur in this location.</p>

VII for the submandibular and sublingual glands and the mucosa of the floor of the mouth and it involves the lesser petrosal nerve from C.N. IX for the parotid gland. In both cases, the PSy postganglionic fibres are distributed to their targets with general sensory branches of V3.</p>
<p>A similar pattern applies for the distribution of PSy fibres to targets in the V2 territory. PSy preganglionic fibres arising from C.N. VII are carried in its branch, the greater petrosal nerve. These fibres synapse onto postganglionic neurons in the pterygopalatine ganglion. The postganglionic axons arising from the pterygopalatine ganglion join, and are distributed with general sensory branches of V2. Thus, they reach the mucosa of the nasal cavities with the lateral nasal and nasopalatine nerves, the hard palate and soft palate with the greater and lesser palatine nerves, and the nasopharynx with the pharyngeal branch of V2.</p>

<p>Review:
The paranasal air sinuses are cavities in the bones of the skull that open into the nasal cavity. They are lined by the same mucus membrane that lines the nasal cavity, and the mucus produced in these sinuses drains through these openings into the nasal cavities. 
The paranasal air sinuses are named according to the bone in which they are located. Thus, they are the frontal sinus (A), ethmoidal air cells (B), the maxillary sinus (C) and sphenoid sinus (see next slide).
The sinuses of the ethmoid bone, the ethmoid air cells, consist of a group of small spaces, much like clusters of soap bubbles, within the lateral masses of the ethmoid bone. Note in the lower diagram that they are located lateral to the sphenoethmoidal recess (D) and the superior (E) and middle (F) meatuses. The posterior ethmoid air cells open into the superior meatus (next slide).  </p>

<p>The sphenopalatine artery (A), a branch of the maxillary artery (B) enters the mucosa of the nasal cavity via the sphenopalatine foramen. Its lateral nasal branches (C) supply much of the lateral wall, and its septal branches (D) cross the roof of the nose to supply blood to the nasal septum. 
While most of the nasal mucosa receive blood from branches of the maxillary artery, 
the ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery (E) supply the olfactory part of the nasal mucosa, and 
branches of the facial artery (F) supply of the mucosa in the anterior part of the nose, and

<p>The lateral nasal branches (A) of the maxillary nerve (V2) supply much of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. 
The nasopalatine branch (B) of the maxillary nerve (V2) crosses the roof of the nose from lateral to medial, from the sphenopalatine foramen to the mucosa of the nasal septum. The distal part of the nasopalatine nerve leaves the anterior part of the septum to pass through the incisive foramen (C) to innervate the anterior portion of the oral surface of the hard palate. Thus, most of the nasal cavity is innervated by branches of the maxillary nerve, V2. 
However, the anterior part of the lateral wall and septum is innervated by branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, V1. These are the anterior ethmoidal nerves (D), which branch from the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve     .</p>

<p>The Pterygopalatine Fossa is a Junction Box</p>
<p>Recall from Lab 4: the infratemporal fossa leads, via the pterygomaxillary fissure, into the pterygopalatine fossa (A). Use the skull provided, with pipe cleaners passed through various foramina, to confirm that the pterygopalatine fossa communicates:
ANTERIORLY with the orbit though the inferior orbital fissure (B), 
MEDIALLY with the nose through the sphenopalatine foramen (C), 
INFERIORLY with the oral cavity through the greater and lesser palatine canals (D), and POSTERIORLY with the cranial cavity through the foramen rotundum (E) and the pterygoid canal (F).</p>
<p>Recall from Lab 4: the maxillary artery enters the pterygopalatine fossa from the infratemporal fossa. There it gives rise to the sphenopalatine artery, which passes, via the sphenopalatine foramen (C) into the nasal cavity.
The maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve, V2, enters the pterygopalatine fossa from the cranial cavity through the foramen rotundum (E). Here it gives rise to many branches, including those which pass through the sphenopalatine foramen into the nasal cavity.

<p>The Pterygopalatine Fossa is a Junction Box</p>
<p>Recall from Lab 4: the infratemporal fossa leads, via the pterygomaxillary fissure, into the pterygopalatine fossa (A). Use the skull provided, with pipe cleaners passed through various foramina, to confirm that the pterygopalatine fossa communicates:
ANTERIORLY with the orbit though the inferior orbital fissure (B), 
MEDIALLY with the nose through the sphenopalatine foramen (C), 
INFERIORLY with the oral cavity through the greater and lesser palatine canals (D), and POSTERIORLY with the cranial cavity through the foramen rotundum (E) and the pterygoid canal (F).</p>
<p>Recall from Lab 4: the maxillary artery enters the pterygopalatine fossa from the infratemporal fossa. There it gives rise to the sphenopalatine artery, which passes, via the sphenopalatine foramen (C) into the nasal cavity.
The maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve, V2, enters the pterygopalatine fossa from the cranial cavity through the foramen rotundum (E). Here it gives rise to many branches, including those which pass through the sphenopalatine foramen into the nasal cavity.
That’s how these nerves and arteries get to the nasal cavity!</p>

<p>DETACH the sternohyoid muscle (A) and the superior belly of the omohyoid (D’) from the hyoid bone (B). Using blunt dissection, turn both muscles inferiorly as far as possible. Deep to these muscles, identify and outline the sternothyroid (F) and thyrohyoid (G) muscles. Like sternohyoid and omohyoid, the names of these muscles simply describe their attachments.</p>
<p>The sternohyoid, omohyoid, sternothyroid and thyrohyoid muscles are the infrahyoid (or strap) muscles. The infrahyoid muscles act to lower the larynx during speech and swallowing. 
The infrahyoid muscles are innervated by branches of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cervical spinal nerves which form a looping structure called the ansa cervicalis from which branches extend to innervate these muscles. The ansa cervicalis lies deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It is not necessary to identify it at this time. </p>

With the exception of the palatoglossus muscle which is innervated by the vagus nerve, CN X, both the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve, CN XII. 
For the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, general sensation (pain, temperature, touch, and pressure) is carried by the lingual branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, V3. Taste is carried by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, CN VII.

<p>To summarize, 4 of the cranial nerves play a major role in the innervation of the tongue. 
With the exception of the palatoglossus muscle which is innervated by the vagus nerve, CN X, both the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve, CN XII. 
For the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, general sensation (pain, temperature, touch, and pressure) is carried by the lingual branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, V3. Taste is carried by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, CN VII. 
For the posterior 1/3 of the tongue, the glossopharyngeal nerve, CN IX, is sensory for both general sensation and taste.</p>

<p>The sublingual gland is innervated by postganglionic parasympathetic fibres that originate with the facial nerve.  Preganglionic fibres, carried in the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, join the lingual branch of the mandibular nerve, V3. The lingual nerve carries them to the floor of the mouth, where they synapse on the submandibular ganglion. The sublingual salivary glands have about a dozen short ducts that open directly into the floor of the mouth. </p>
