layers of the scalp and associated structures.
lymphatic drainage of the superficial and deep structures of the face, including the major groups of lymph nodes.</p>

<p>The scalp is a complex, multilayered structure covering the neurocranium. It extends from the superior border of the orbit, anteriorly, to the external occipital protuberance and adjacent part of the occipital bone, posteriorly. Laterally, it extends down to the level of the zygomatic arch. 
It consists of 5 layers. The outermost 3 layers adhere tightly to each other, and, from superficial to deep, consist of the skin, a layer of dense connective tissue (CT) and an aponeurotic layer. The layer of dense CT is well vascularized and it adheres to the vessels. This prevents the vessels from constricting when cut, which is why scalp lacerations typically bleed profusely. 
Deep to the aponeurosis is a layer of very loose CT. This is why it is so easy to slide the scalp back and forth on the skull. Unfortunately, this layer offers little resistance, and acts as a cleavage plane that makes it relatively easy to separate from the skull. It also offers little resistance to the spread of infections which gain entry to this layer. 
The deepest layer of the 5 layers in the scalp is the periosteum of the skull. You will recall from the histology eModule on bone, that the periosteum is the dense irregular CT layer that surrounds bone.</p>

<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>6A   The Occipitofrontalis Muscle</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>The middle, aponeurotic layer of the scalp connects the 2 bellies of the occipitofrontalis muscle. The occipital belly arises from the occipital bone to blend with the aponeurosis. The frontalis belly, which is responsible for wrinkling the skin of the forehead, arises from the skin of the eyebrows and extends into the aponeurosis.
The occipitofrontalis is a muscle of facial expression, and is innervated by the facial nerve. Asking a patient to raise their eyebrows is part of the neurological exam, and tests for the integrity of the facial nerve.</p>

<p>none</p>
<p>These vessels anastomose freely within the dense connective tissue layer of the scalp. Venous drainage is by veins of the same name that accompany the arteries. However, an additional route of venous drainage is available via the emissary veins which penetrate the skull bones to empty into intracranial vessels (left). The emissary veins provide a potential route for scalp infections to spread intracranially.</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>The scalp receives a rich blood supply from the:
supraorbital and supratrochlear branches of the ophthalmic arteries anteriorly, 
the superficial temporal branches of the external carotid arteries laterally, and 
the posterior auricular branches of the external carotid arteries posteriorly. </p>

<p>none</p>
<p>Lymphatic vessels from the scalp and face follow the arteries. They eventually reach a superficial group of nodes that form a ring around the base of the skull. These nodes cluster into several groups, the names of which are regional and therefore intuitive. 
These are the:
occipital nodes
retroauricular (mastoid) nodes
preauricular (parotid) nodes
submandibular nodes
submental nodes</p>

<p>Next</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>The occipital, retroauricular, and preauricular nodes drain directly into the deep cervical nodes, located along the course of the internal jugular vein.</p>
<p>The submental nodes receive lymph from the lower lip, the anterior, inferior part of the gingiva and tip of the tongue. The submandibular nodes receive lymph from the tongue and floor of the mouth. These two groups of nodes drain into the superficial cervical nodes, located along the course of the external jugular vein. </p>
<p>The superficial cervical nodes drain in turn to the deep cervical nodes, which makes the latter chain along the internal jugular vein the final common pathway for lymphatic drainage from the head and neck to the jugular lymph trunks.
You will recall that the jugular trunks ultimately empty lymph into the right and left venous angles.</p>

<p>Several groups of deep cervical nodes are described, and again, their names reflect their location. These include the retropharyngeal, paratracheal, and infrahyoid, draining the posterior part of the tongue, pharynx, esophagus, larynx, trachea and thyroid gland. </p>
<p>The jugulodigastric node is a node that is consistently located just inferior to where the posterior belly of the digastric muscle crosses the internal jugular vein. It is significant because it receives lymph directly from the palatine tonsil and surrounding tissue.</p>

<p>Objectives:
When you have completed this pre-lab exercise,you will be able to describe the:
subdivisions of the pharynx, including their major features.
retropharyngeal space.
muscles of the pharynx, including their actions and nerve supply.
internal features of the pharynx.
nerves and vessels associated with the pharynx.</p>
<h2>10. The Pharynx: An Overview</h2>
<p>Rectangle 1</p>
<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>Picture 2</p>
<p>6A   The Pharynx: An Overview</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>The pharynx is a passage common to both the respiratory and digestive systems. It extends from the base of the skull to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage at the level of the 6th cervical vertebra. </p>
<p>There are 3 layers to its wall; the inner mucosa, the middle muscular layer, and an outer layer of connective tissue called the buccopharyngeal fascia.
The pharynx opens anteriorly and is subdivided into 3 regions accordingly:
1.	The nasopharynx opens into the nasal cavity. The nasopharynx extends from the base of the skull to the tip of the soft palate. 
2.	The oropharynx opens into the mouth. The oropharynx extends from the tip of the soft palate to the upper margin of the epiglottis     .
3.	The laryngopharynx opens into the larynx. The laryngopharynx extends from the upper margin of the epiglottis to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage.</p>

<p>none</p>
<p>6A   The Muscles of the Pharynx</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>The muscular layer of the wall of the pharynx consists of an outer layer of circularly arranged muscles called the pharyngeal constrictors and an incomplete inner longitudinal layer formed by three paired muscles.</p>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>The superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors are paired muscles that attach anteriorly to the skull, hyoid bone and thyroid and cricoid cartilages, respectively. The fibres of each of the constrictor muscles pass posteriorly, and medially to meet the muscle from the opposite side in a midline pharyngeal raphe     . The pharyngeal raphe is anchored superiorly to the pharyngeal tubercle on the occipital bone, just anterior to the foramen magnum.</p>
<p>11</p>
<h2>12. The Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor</h2>
<p>Rectangle 1</p>
<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>6A   The Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>The superior pharyngeal constrictor attaches anteriorly to the medial pterygoid plate and to the mandible and to an intervening ligament called the pterygomandibular raphe. Attachment to the pterygomandibular raphe is shared by the superior constrictor posteriorly and the buccinator muscle anteriorly. 
The gap in the musculature of the pharynx created between the uppermost fibres of the superior constrictor and the base of the skull is filled with a thick layer of connective tissue called the pharyngobasilar or pharyngeal fascia.</p>

<p>Rectangle 1</p>
<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>6A   The Middle and Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictors</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>The inferior constrictor attaches to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages anteriorly. The fibres of the inferior constrictor that are attached to the cricoid cartilage form the cricopharyngeus muscle. Cricopharyngeus is the upper esophageal sphincter. The sphincter is normally closed to prevent air form entering the digestive tract, but relaxes as part of the swallowing reflex to allow a bolus of food to pass. The upper fibres of the inferior constrictor overlap and partially encircle the middle constrictor. </p>
<p>Anteriorly, the middle constrictor attaches to the greater horn of the hyoid bone and to the stylohyoid ligament that connects the styloid process to the lesser horn. The upper fibres of the middle constrictor overlap and partially encircle the superior constrictor.</p>

<h2>14. Longitudinal Muscles of the Pharynx</h2>
<p>Rectangle 1</p>
<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>6A   Longitudinal Muscles of the Pharynx</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>The longitudinally-oriented muscles of the pharynx are the stylopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus and the palatopharyngeus. The stylopharyngeus enters the pharynx by passing between the superior and middle constrictors. </p>
<p>The longitudinally-oriented muscles of the pharynx function to raise the pharynx during swallowing. This, coordinated with the narrowing of the pharynx behind a bolus of food through contraction of the constrictors, acts to propel food downward and into the esophagus.</p>

<h2>15. Nerve Supply to the Pharynx</h2>
<p>Rectangle 1</p>
<p>Rectangle 2</p>
<p>6A   Nerve Supply to the Pharynx</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>All muscles of the pharynx are innervated by pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve, except for the stylopharyngeus which is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve. 
Stylopharyngeus, in fact, is the only muscle innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.
Sensation from the pharyngeal mucosa is carried from the: </p>
<p>none</p>
<p>nasopharynx by pharyngeal branches of the maxillary nerve, 
oropharynx by the glossopharyngeal nerve, and 
laryngopharynx by the internal laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which arises from the vagus nerve. </p>

<p>The pharynx is a passage common to both the respiratory and digestive systems. It extends from the base of the skull to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage at the level of the 6th cervical vertebra. </p>
<p>There are 3 layers to its wall; the inner mucosa, the middle muscular layer, and an outer layer of connective tissue called the buccopharyngeal fascia.
The pharynx opens anteriorly and is subdivided into 3 regions accordingly:
1.	The nasopharynx opens into the nasal cavity. The nasopharynx extends from the base of the skull to the tip of the soft palate.
2.	The oropharynx opens into the mouth. The oropharynx extends from the tip of the soft palate to the upper margin of the epiglottis     .
3.	The laryngopharynx opens into the larynx. The laryngopharynx extends from the margin of the epiglottis to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage.</p>

In the nasopharynx, identify the opening of the pharyngotympanic tube (auditory tube, or, Eustacian tube). 
The pharyngotympanic tube is a passage that connects the nasopharynx with the middle ear, an air filled space in the temporal bone. </p>

<p>Next</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>Otitis Media</p>
<p>INFO</p>
<p>The wall of the pharyngotympanic tube where it opens into the nasopharynx is supported by elastic cartilage, which confers the ability of the tube to open and close. The tube is usually closed except when pressure increases in the nasopharynx, or, during swallowing and yawning, when the action of </p>
<p>Equilibration of Pressure Across the Tympanic Membrane</p>
<p>INFO</p>
<p>The pharyngotympanic tube also allows a route through which air pressure in the middle ear can equilibrate with atmospheric pressure. Most have experienced the action of the pharyngotympanic tube when taking off in an airplane. As ambient pressure begins to drop, the air trapped in the </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>several muscles attaching around the tube create traction on the opening. The middle ear is lined with a mucous membrane, and the pharyngotympanic tube provides a route for drainage of the fluid produced by the membrane. Inflammation of the mucosa in the tube can interfere with normal drainage leading to fluid build-up in the middle ear. This can provide a medium for bacterial growth, leading to ear infection (otitis media). The pharyngotympanic tube is shorter, more horizontal, and narrower in children, making them prone to recurring middle ear infections. The fluid build-up in the middle ear with recurring middle ear infections in children may impair conductive hearing. To prevent this, sometimes it becomes necessary to insert tympanostomy tubes through the tympanic membrane in order to provide an alternate route for drainage. </p>
<p>middle ear will expand, distorting the tympanic membrane, creating a sensation of pressure. When the pharyngotympanic tube opens, for instance during swallowing, the pressure of air in the middle ear equilibrates with atmospheric pressure and the sensation is relieved.</p>

<p>Previous</p>
<p>The muscular layer of the wall of the pharynx consists of an outer layer of circularly arranged muscles called the pharyngeal constrictors and an incomplete inner longitudinal layer formed by three paired muscles.</p>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>The superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors are paired muscles that attach anteriorly to the skull, hyoid bone and thyroid and cricoid cartilages, respectively. The fibres of each of the constrictor muscles pass posteriorly, and medially to meet the muscle from the opposite side in a midline pharyngeal raphe     . The pharyngeal raphe is anchored superiorly to the pharyngeal tubercle on the occipital bone, just anterior to the foramen magnum.</p>

<p>6.3   The Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>The superior pharyngeal constrictor attaches anteriorly to the medial pterygoid plate, the mandible and to an intervening ligament called the pterygomandibular raphe. Attachment to the pterygomandibular raphe is shared by the superior constrictor posteriorly and the buccinator muscle anteriorly. 
The gap in the musculature of the pharynx created between the uppermost fibres of the superior constrictor and the base of the skull is filled with a thick layer of connective tissue called the pharyngobasilar or pharyngeal fascia.</p>

<p>6.3   The Middle and Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictors</p>
<p>Previous</p>
<p>The inferior constrictor attaches to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages anteriorly. The fibres of the inferior constrictor that are attached to the cricoid cartilage form the cricopharyngeus muscle. Cricopharyngeus is the upper esophageal sphincter. The sphincter is normally closed to prevent air form entering the digestive tract, but relaxes as part of the swallowing reflex to allow a bolus of food to pass. The upper fibres of the inferior constrictor overlap and partially encircle the middle constrictor. </p>
<p>Anteriorly, the middle constrictor attaches to the greater horn of the hyoid bone and to the stylohyoid ligament that connects the styloid process to the lesser horn. The upper fibres of the middle constrictor overlap and partially encircle the superior constrictor.</p>

<p>The longitudinally-oriented muscles of the pharynx are the stylopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus and the palatopharyngeus. The stylopharyngeus enters the pharynx by passing between the superior and middle constrictors. </p>
<p>The longitudinally-oriented muscles of the pharynx function to raise the pharynx during swallowing. This, coordinated with the narrowing of the pharynx behind a bolus of food through contraction of the constrictors, acts to propel food downward and into the esophagus.</p>

<p>The vertebral artery is the first branch of the subclavian. It quickly enters the foramen transversarium of C6 and then ascends through the remaining foramina transversaria to the base of the skull. 
It enters the neurocranium through the foramen magnum to supply blood the brainstem, cerebellum and occipital lobes. </p>

<p>Since embarking on this exercise, you have identified the following structures and learned the answers to the following questions:
sternocleidomastoid muscle and accessory nerve; what other muscle does the accessory nerve innervate?
posterior belly of the digastric and stylohyoid muscle, tip of the greater horn of the hyoid bone, hypoglossal nerve
external laryngeal nerve and superior thyroid artery arising from the external carotid artery 
lobe and isthmus of the thyroid gland; does the thyroid gland in your cadaver have a pyramidal lobe?
cricothyroid muscle (action? effect on voice? innervation?), cricothyroid ligament (what is cricothyrotomy?)
the thyrohyoid membrane, thyrohyoid muscle, internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (origin? function? distribution?), external branch of superior laryngeal nerve (function? distribution?)
both right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves (origin? function? distribution?),
What are the contents of the carotid sheath?
the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery, external and internal carotid arteries, carotid sinus (what is the carotid sinus?), the superior thyroid, lingual, and facial arteries
vagus nerve, sympathetic chain, superior cervical ganglion; What are the internal and external carotid plexuses?
the anterior scalene muscle, the phrenic nerve (what are its spinal roots? what functional fibre types does it contain?), the subclavian vein, subclavian artery, roots of the brachial plexus, middle scalene muscle
the thyrocervical trunk, inferior thyroid artery, the thyroid ima artery (if present) the vertebral artery; describe the venous drainage of the thyroid gland
If you are satisfied with your ability to identify these structures and answer these questions, call your TA over for confirmation and for permission to move on.</p>
